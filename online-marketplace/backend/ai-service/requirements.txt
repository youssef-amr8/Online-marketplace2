# Classical Extractive Summarization - BEST lightweight option
# Uses TextRank algorithm to select most representative sentences

# Primary: sumy (TextRank) - Currently active (spaCy has Python 3.14 compatibility issues)
sumy>=0.11.0

# NLTK (required by sumy)
nltk>=3.8

# Optional: spaCy (Industry-grade, optimized Cython)
# NOTE: spaCy currently has compatibility issues with Python 3.14+
# Will automatically fall back to sumy if spaCy fails
# spacy>=3.7.0

# Note: After installation, download NLTK data:
# python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"
#
# If using spaCy (Python < 3.14), download English model:
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
